#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

###Summary
This repositary includes script file `run_analysis.R` that downloads and preprocesses the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**, *Version 1.0*. The final dataset is average of each variable (mean and standard deviation) for each activity and each subject. See `CodeBook.md` for further details on method used for obtaining & cleaning the data.

###Procedure
Run the script from the working directory. The script produces a single output file under the tree `Final_Project/UCI HAR Dataset/tidy_data.txt`. The resulting `tidy_data.txt` file contains the tidy data.
